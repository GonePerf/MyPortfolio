msgid "Elasticsearch"
msgstr "I have practical experience with Elasticsearch, gained mainly through my work at OPGK. In a team of three, we designed and implemented a package extending OTRS with Elasticsearch due to the low efficiency of SQL. Our module works in parallel with a MySQL database and, by using the right mechanism mechanism that triggers specific actions e.g. when adding a new request, the data in the Elasticsearch data are automatically updated on an ongoing basis."

msgid "Vue"
msgstr "I first encountered Vue two years ago during an internship at Ideo. This framework immediately appealed to me and I intend to use it. I have hands-on experience with Vue.js 2.0. With Vue 2.0, I can create dynamic and interactive web applications using component-based architecture, reactive data binding, routing, etc. I am familiar with Vue.js 3.0, the latest version of Vue.js. Vue 3.0 introduces several improvements, including a faster rendering engine, better TypeScript support and improved responsiveness with the Composition API."

msgid "DJango"
msgstr "I like Python because it has a very simple syntax. I've been using DJango for about a month now. I wrote this page using just DJango - SSR has the advantage of sending ready-made HTML documents to the user so I decided not to use Vue here. The application has a SQLite database and I can edit the description of any technology or project at any time and also add new elements."
