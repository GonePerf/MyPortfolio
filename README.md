## Description

The Portfolio Project is written in Django and provides information about my skills, the tools I use, and the projects I have worked on. It serves as a platform where I can showcase my achievements and share contact information.

## Tools

In my Portfolio Project, I have utilized the following tools:

- Django: A web framework written in Python.
- HTML: The interface designed to run on various devices in the simplest way possible.
- SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that allows for readable and intuitive styling.
- JavaScript: A script that changes the ID of the main element, influencing the color scheme of the page.
- SQLite: A file-based database.
- Gunicorn: An HTTP server for Python applications.
- Heroku: A platform for deploying and hosting web applications.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure the database settings in the `settings.py` file.
4. Perform database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.
5. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.
6. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.
